## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

1. build the markup out with semantic html

2. add to this by styling out the project and the ui with css

2. make the functionally work using javascript




### What I learned
Doing this challenege i managed to nail down some finer points when doing form validation , i knew how to do it but it was a case of practice the process.




### Continued development
I will do more form validation while i continue to leanr and dive deeper into javascript.
